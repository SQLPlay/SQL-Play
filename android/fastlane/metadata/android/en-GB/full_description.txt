Beautiful SQL runner app for those who want to run SQL commands in their phone.
It comes with a sample database so that you can run all sorts of query to the employee, customer, songs and artists.

New export feature allows you to export any table in CSV and also share it with anyone.

History and swipe features are awesome, it gives you autocompletions and history of all the commands which you have run.

This app has dark mode so that you can keep practicing even at night by being night owl ðŸ¦‰.

If you want to lookup for any SQL command  or syntax the app has that also and you can copy that to the input directly. This allows you to search through SQL queries without leaving the app.
